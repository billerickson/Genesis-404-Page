Customize the content of the 404 Page within the Genesis Framework.

== Description ==

Customizing the contents of the _Page Not Found_ page in any WordPress theme can be tricky, and usually involes editing the 404.php template file. The Genesis Framework already abstracts the default content of the page into a function, and this plugin can unhook that and replace it with your own custom title and content.

Use [genesis-404-search] shortcode to add a search form to the page.

If you'd like to dynamically list content (ex: most recent posts), I recommend you install the [Display Posts Shortcode](http://www.wordpress.org/extend/plugins/display-posts-shortcode/) and use it in the 404 page's content.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `genesis-404-page` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Customize your 404 page's title and content in Genesis > 404 Page. 

== Screenshots ==

1. Admin screen showing the fields for custom 404 Not Found page title and content.
